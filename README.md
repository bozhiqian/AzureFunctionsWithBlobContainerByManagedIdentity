# Upload file to Azure Blob Container Demo

Upload file to Azure Blob Container from Azure Functions (**v4** on **.net 6**) By Azure **Managed Identity**.


Configurations:

1. Assigne your azure identity with "**Storage Blob Data Contributor**" and "**Storage Blob Data Owner**" in order to debug at VS2022. Once the azure function has been deployed to Azure, please grant its managed identity for these two role assignments instead.
